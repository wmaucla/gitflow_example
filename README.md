Adding a basic README file


Useful commands:

git status - see what the current status of files is
git branch - see what branches you have
git add - add a file to be committed 
git commit - commits a file
git log - shows previous commits


Typical Workflow:

git checkout -b branch_name # create a new branch
git push origin branch_name # adds to origin (github)

git status # just to see what's changed
git add file_name # add a file that you've edited
git commit -m "my_message" # add a message plus commit the files staged
git push # send the files to github 

git checkout develop # switch to the branch you are going to merge into
git merge develop # and merge branches
